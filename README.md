## About

The MyReads project displays a "bookcase" with books on three different shelves, "Curently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read". You can move each book to a different shelf using the green button on the book cover. You may also search for other books by clicking the + icon on the bottom right. Here you can enter a search term at the top, the results will display and then you may select the shelf for any of the books.

## Instructions

To get started using the app:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`
